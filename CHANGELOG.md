# Changelog

## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-20

### Added
- **1:1 Real-Time Clock Synchronization (`rtz_clock.script`)**:
  - Enforces a 1:1 real-time `time_factor` (`1.0` default, configurable `1.0–10.0` in MCM).
  - Synchronizes the in-game clock (`HH:MM`) with the host OS wall clock on game load and level transition, with circular sub-minute wrap protection.
  - Added post-jump vitals and surge/psi-storm safeguards so syncing the clock after hours offline never causes starvation, dehydration, exhaustion blackouts, or immediate overdue emissions.
- **Live Real-World Weather Engine (`rtz_weather.script`, `_tools/fetch_rtz_hourly.py`, `setup_rtz.bat`)**:
  - Reads hour-by-hour Open-Meteo weather forecasts (`rtz_weather.ltx`) and *Seasons of the Zone*'s `season_weather.ltx` (with built-in diurnal fallback) to drive in-game weather cycles (`clear`, `partly`, `cloudy`, `foggy`, `rain`, `storm`, `snow`).
  - Syncs `WeatherManager.day_plan` so *Seasons of the Zone*'s in-game PDA Forecast tab displays the real-world schedule.
  - Non-destructively hooks both **Atmospherics** (`WeatherManager.get_next_weather_cycle`) and **W.P.W.M.** (`WeatherManager.check_day_plan`).
  - Included one-click `setup_rtz.bat` installer inside the mod folder so any user can install `_tools/fetch_rtz_hourly.py` into `GAMMA\_tools` and hook `play.bat` automatically.
- **Real-Time Bed & Campfire Resting (`rtz_rest.script`, `ui_rtz_rest.xml`)**:
  - Replaces multi-hour time-skip sleeping with the interactive `UIRtzRest` screen (progress bar, real-time clock, comfort bonus, `SPACE`/`ESC` or button wake-up, danger/damage interrupt, and autosave on wake).
  - Added passive fatigue recovery when resting near lit campfires (`bind_campfire.campfires_all`).
- **MCM Configuration & Localization (`rtz_mcm.script`, `ui_mcm_rtz.xml`)**:
  - Full MCM menu (`rtz`) with English and Russian (`windows-1251`) localizations.
